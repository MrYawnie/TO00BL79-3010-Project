> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- The experience was OK, and as expected. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I wrote the test cases while experimenting/running tests on the website. Essentially I wrote the test cases while 'running' the tests. I followed the instructions and create a couple of additional tests.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I would clarify linked objects with ${title} -designation instead of 'Title' as shown on course examples


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- VSCode


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not encounter issues other than not having the captcha pop-up during registration. 


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- No issues, have used GitHub before on multiple school projects as well as numerous personal projects.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- As I have no experience with any of them, I would test and compare each one of them (or at least a few), and then come to the solution. I would likely start with Robot Framework, as it seems simple and easily understandable, and the syntax is very similar to the one practiced during this course project.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Strong understanding of software QA methodologies, tools and processes
- Strong communication and teamwork skills
- Problem-solving skills
- Ability to write clear and concise test plans and cases




## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Good knowledge of several testing frameworks
- Clear understanding of QA methodologies




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I did learn new things regarding testing and testing software during this course. I was not familiar of different types of Quality Assurance methods, and the course did open my eyes a bit regarding the importance of testing, especially automated testing. The videos were quite interesting, and it was nice that a test project was implemented. However, I wish a testing framework was introduced as a part of the project, or any task. I felt that the automation part was missing during this course, however, this was an introductory course and therefore acceptable as is.
